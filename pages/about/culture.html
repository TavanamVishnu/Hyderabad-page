Embracing a fusion of Indo-Islamic and European architectural styles, the city showcases remarkable palaces such as the Chowmohallah Palace and Falaknuma Palace, reflecting their penchant for opulence and refinement. Nizam's patronage of arts and crafts led to the flourishing of Bidriware and Kalamkari crafts, and their love for literature and poetry nurtured a rich literary tradition in Urdu.
